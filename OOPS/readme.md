# Object Oriented Programming

*Program in terms of objects.*
 
## Class: 
 * A blueprint to define a user defined object.
 * It can have data members and fucntions.
 * Access modifierrs: 
    * Private
    * Public
    * By default it is private.
 * Getters: To get the value of a particular variable.
 * Setters: To set the value of a particular variable.
 * Default Methods:
   * Constructor
      * Special function having propoerties as mentioned below.
          * Constructor name is same as the name of the class.
          * It gets called automatically when we create a object.
          * It allocates all the memory for that object.
          * We can override the default constructor.
          * Constructor with some parameters is called parameterised constructor.
          * But only one of the constructor will be called.
   * Copy constructor
      * The goal is to create a copy of the given object of the same type.
      * Shallow and deep copy.
      
   * Copy Assignment
   * Destructor

## Pillar of OOPS

 1. Data Abstraction
 2. Inheritance
 3. Polymorphism 
 4. Encapsulation (Data hide)

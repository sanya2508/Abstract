# Recursion and Backtracking

## Recursion
 * A method where solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
 * Parts of recursive algorithm:
    * Base case
    * Recursive call ( to work towards base case)
 * Easiest way to approach to recursion problem:
   1. Figure out the base case.
   2. Assume sub problems can be solved by recursion (automatically).
   3. Using the sub-problems write the answer for the current problem.

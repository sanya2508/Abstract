### CHARACTER ARRAY
 * In case of integer array, on printing the array name directly we get the address of array, whereas  in case of char array we get the elements of the array unless it finds a NULL. (This is because of operator overloading).
 * In case of character array we don't need to use loop to take input.
 * Reading Sentences:
     * cin doesnot input spaces.
     * use cin.get() [It reads a single character at a time].
     * cin.getline(array,maxlength,delimiter).
 * Palindromic String:
     * Start comparing with the first and last character.
     
 * Remove consecutive duplicate characters from a string.
 * Find the largest string and it's length.
